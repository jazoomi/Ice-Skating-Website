                <p>Hello! Its nice to meet you, let me give you an introduction of me along with experience so you know who you are hiring... I am a professional ice skating instructor for about a year
                    now, primarly by the YorkU school. Throughout my skating career, I have a constant stream of questions in local ice rinks on tips, and it's very satisfying to see them take it as useful. 
                However, these skaters often tell me about the absurd prices they pay for skating lessons and it was dissapointing to see they still haven't made skating progress with it... This gave me the motive 
            to give locals the chance to learn to skate while not breaking their wallet. I only teach beginner and new skaters as I specilize in footwork which is friendly for those levels of skaters. I do NOT cover 
            more advanced concepts past a walt jump (such as axel, twizzle, etc...)
        <br>
        When, where, how?
        <br>
        I primarly teach by John Booth arena and Canlan ice rink, which both are very close to YorkU. Although these are my most common rinks,
         I am throughout toronto and can work in various areas. I provide skates if needed as well as helments or knee guards if requested. As the schedule is not fix, times are given after contacted. 
         Group classes will consist of explaining the movments, demonstrating, then preforming.
